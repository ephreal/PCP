\chapter{Introduction} \label{Introduction}

Welcome to Pop Culture RPG (PRPG), a simple tabletop RPG system designed
for ease of character creation, ease of play, and ease in general. The system
was designed for people who have never played a tabletop RPG before and may
want to, but have been put off by complicated rulesets. In PRPG core, rules are
kept to a bare minumum to provide simple guidance on how to resolve things.
This gives both the person running the game (the GM) and the players great
flexability and control over how the game progresses.

While having a very loose ruleset is great for the GM, it can become a bit
confusing to keep track of everything in the game. For example, what if you
want to add in player skills to make the game less random? How is that supposed
to be handled in Pop-Culture RPG? And what about items? Do the players even
have an inventory? And what kinds of things might attack the players? Coming up
with all of these on the fly can create items or monsters that are easily able
to take out anything in their way with one roll.

This book extends the core ruleset by providing for additional things such as
skills and items. Ensure you are familiar with the core rulebook before reading
this rulebook. This rulebook will assume you have read and understand the
core rules.
