\chapter{Character Creation}

Character creation consists of three steps.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item{Come up with or find a character concept}
    \item{Come up with powers for that character}
    \item{Get the powers checked by the GM}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Coming up with a character concept}

While it's entirely possible to come up with a character concept out of thin
air, it's recommended to use a character from a show or movie you like. This
makes it easier for you to have a personality and a set of power in mind and,
hopefully, the GM will also be somewhat familiar with the character too. If
not, at least a quick google search will give some idea of what to expect.

Due to worries of copyright complications, here is a fake show that hopefully
sounds somewhat familiar to you that all examples will be used from.

ChaWiOh has young, spiky haired protagonist with an ability to transform into
an older mysterious version of himself. The character is able to place cards
onto a machine that extends from his wrist to summon monsters according to many
(often arbitrary and seemingly made up) rules.

\section*{What makes up a character?}

In PCP, a character has 4 things that need to be tracked. Health, Protagonist
Points, Powers, and Focus.

Health is a measure of how much damage the character can take and how badly
injured the character looks. Every character starts with 10 points which can be
increased later on with focus (10 focus to one health) or a power. When the
character reaches 0 health, the character is unconscious. Despite being
unconscious, the character can still mumble important and mysterous sounding
things in the manner of many a protagonist.

A character's Protagonist Points are a measure of how many times the character
can use powers. The points are all recovered anytime the character has had a
chance to get a good night's sleep in. Points can also be recovered anytime
the character acts particularly `protagonist-y' (GM's discretion). The amount
of points a character has can be increased with focus (10 focus to one point).

Powers are things the character is able to do that the average person cannot.
Most of these powers cost points to use, although each character will have
one that does not from the start. The one that requires no points is assumed
to be the character's most commonly used power. Because powers are made by the
players, the GM should double check them to ensure nothing is too powerful
(according to the GM). Powers can be gained by spending focus later on. The GM
decided how much a particular power costs to aquire. More powerful powers
should cost more.

Focus represents what the character spends their time improving. Points are
gained for particularly `protagonist-y' acts, accomplishing tasks, and by
the GM at the end of any game. Focus is mostly important for games that will
extend beyond more than one session.

\section*{Coming up with powers}

Each character is able to start the game with 4 powers: 1 innate power that
either costs no points or is always on, and 3 that cost protagonist points to
use. The player comes up with powers that fit the character, and the GM
decides how many points the power should cost. Avoid horribly complicated and
detailed powers if possible.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{GM Review}
\section*{GM Review}
It's important that the GM at least glance over the powers to ensure they are
a good match within the game planned and the power cost is adequate. A player
shouldn't have to spend 6 points on a power that lets her summon a small blue
light. Conversely, neither should the player be able to spend 1 point to
summon Galaxar, destroyer of worlds and eater of souls.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Character Creation Example}
\section*{Character Creation Example}

Let's create the main character from ChaWiOh: Chawi.

Chawi has one extremely notable power: the ability to summon and duel with
his deck. Because this power will be used so frequently, this will be the
power that has no cost to it.

In addition to this power, other powers that Chawi seems to have because he is
a main character in the show are

\begin{enumerate}

    \item{Picking the right card at at improbable times}
    \item{Playing multiple cards despite that being a violation of all rules}
    \item{Ignoring the rules of the card game}

\end{enumerate}

The GM looks over the powers and decides that the first one is worth 1 point,
the second is worth 3 points, and the third is worth 2 points.

With that, Chawi is ready to play.
