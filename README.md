# PRPG
Pop-Culture RPG is a simple tabletop RPG designed with people who have not played a tabletop RPG before in mind. I would, however, recommend that the GM be experienced in running a tabletop game because the small ruleset makes knowing how to handle situations difficult at times. To make the game beginner friendly, it:

* Has very small ruleset
* Has a very small sourcebook
* Uses dice most people already own

## How do  I start?

Read through [the sourcebook](https://github.com/ephreal/Pop-CultureRPG/blob/master/pop-culture%20rpg.pdf), grab a six sided die, find some other people to join you, and start.

## No, seriously, how do I start?
If you are a GM, familiarize yourself with the rolling rules in chapter 2 and character rules in chapter 3. If you are new to GMing, read through chapter 5 as well. It has some advice for GMs. Overall, you'll find there is very little to learn, freeing you up to concentrate on creating a world or story for your players.

If you are a player, start by thinking of what character you want to play. I recommend choosing a character from pop culture. For example, let's say you want to create everyone's favorite [blue speed mouse](https://youtu.be/4TiCF4hMBC8?t=120). Start by creating a list of 4 things he can do, 1 of which is the thing he's most known for. In this case, your list might look like

* Runs at super sonic speeds
* Roll into ball for protection
* Spinning ball dash attack
* Can fly with some special gems

Let the GM review your powers and assign a point value to them. In this case, the GM decides that curling into a ball for protection has no point value, meaning it is free to use. The GM then assigns a 1 to the remaining abilities because as a whole, they are very specific or have a small area of effect.

If you disagree with the point values, talk to the GM, the GM IS your friend. You might know something the GM doesn't or vice versa.

Now you grab a sheet of paper, write HP: 10, PP: 10 at the top, write your skills on it, and you're ready to play.

I STILL recommend reading the sourcebook. At the bare minimum, you need to read chapter 2, and I highly recommend reading chapter 3 too. They're short, I swear!
